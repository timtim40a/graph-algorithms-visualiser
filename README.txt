## Getting Started IF YOU CLONE THE REPOSITORY

To launch the Visualiser you need to have Node.js (or at least npm) installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website or use winget, if you installed it previously

```bash
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
```

Then, once you have downloaded the npm, you can check if it works by typing:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Launch the terminal in this folder, or navigate to it using cd _your path_/final-year-project
The only dependency that you need from the npm is Next.js. You can install it using the following command

```bash
npm install next
```

## Running the Visualiser on Local Server

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can also use setup.cmd on Windows to clone the Github repository into a particular folder.

Open [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004) with your browser to see the result.
GAV supports Chrome, Firefox and Safari without any problems
